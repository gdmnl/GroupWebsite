    <div class="moose-content">
        <p>Mainstream LSM-tree-based key-value stores face challenges in optimizing performance for point lookup,
            range lookup, and update operations concurrently due to their constrained configurations. They typically
            follow fixed patterns to specify the level capacity and the number of sorted runs per-level. This confines their
            designs to a restricted space, limiting opportunities for broader optimizations.</p>
            
            <p>To address this challenge, we consider a more flexible configuration that enables independent adjustments
            of the number of runs per-level, size ratio, and Bloom filter settings at each LSM-tree level. By carefully
            analyzing the cost of each operation based on the new design space, we unveil two critical insights for
            optimizing the tradeoff among the three operations. Firstly, achieving efficient point lookup requires a large
            last level. Secondly, there is a specific correlation between the number of runs per level and size ratio that is
            advantageous for overall update and range lookup performance.</p>
            
            <p>Based on these insights, we introduce Moose, a structure delivering an impressive overall performance
            for point lookup, range lookup, and update concurrently. Furthermore, we also introduce a new framework,
            Smoose, to navigate the design space for adapting specific workloads. We implemented Moose and Smoose on
            top of RocksDB and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art
            LSM-tree structures across diverse workloads.</p>
